This library wraps the Location APIs in Kotlin coroutines and `Flow`.

# Usage

Create a `CoLocation` or `CoGeocoding` instance, preferably by using a dependency injection framework. `CoLocation` is
very similar to the classes provided by the Location APIs. Instead of `LocationServices.getFusedLocationProviderClient(context).lastLocation`
you can use `coLocation.getLastLocation()`. Make sure to have the Location permission from Marshmallow on, if they are
needed by your API requests.

Example:

```kotlin
val coLocation = CoLocation.from(context);
val coGeocoder = CoGeocoder.from(context);

val locationRequest = LocationRequest.create()
        .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
        .setInterval(5000)

val locationUpdates: MutableLiveData<Location> = MutableLiveData()
val addressUpdates: LiveData<Address?> = locationUpdates.switchMap { location ->
        liveData { emit(coGeocoder.getAddressFromLocation(location)) }
    }

val job = viewModelScope.launch {
    try {
        coLocation.getLocationUpdates(locationRequest).collect(mutableLocationUpdates::postValue)
    } catch (e: CancellationException) {
        // Location updates cancelled
    }
}

// The updates get canceled automatically when viewModelScope is cancelled.
// If you want to cancel it before that, save the job and cancel it.
job.cancel()
```

The following APIs are wrapped by this library:

* `FusedLocationProviderClient` via `CoLocation`
* `SettingsClient` via `CoLocation`
* `Geocoder` via `CoGeocoder`

Checking the location settings is simplified with this library, by providing a `SettingsResult` via
`coLocation.checkLocationSettings(locationRequest)`:

```kotlin
val settingsResult = coLocation.checkLocationSettings(locationRequest)

when (settingsResult) {
    SettingsResult.Satisfied -> startLocationUpdates()
    is SettingsResult.Resolvable -> settingsResult.resolve(activity, REQUEST_SHOW_SETTINGS)
    else -> { /* Ignore for now, we can't resolve this anyway */ }
}

override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    if (requestCode == REQUEST_SHOW_SETTINGS && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
        // Resolution success, location settings are now satisfied
        startLocationUpdates()
    }
}
```

Library has a support for newest Huawei devices with **HMS**. Library automatically chooses available
location provider (GMS or HMS), but also is able to run with the specific `LocationServicesSource`:
```
// Will use the HMS for fetching location
CoLocation.from(appContext, LocationServicesSource.HMS)
```

# Sample

A basic sample app is available in the `sample` project.

# Setup

The library is available on Maven Central. Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.patloew.colocation:colocation:1.1.0'
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:18.0.0'
}
```

If you want to use a newer version of Google Play Services or Huawei Mobile Services, declare the newer version in your `build.gradle`. This then
overrides the version declared in the library.

For **HMS** devices you have to have a Huawei configured project (see more https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/dev-process-0000001050746141). HMS location will not work on devices without HMS and on projects without `agconnect-services.json` with Huawei specific configuration.

CoLocation only works with Android Gradle Plugin 3.0.0 or higher, since it uses Java 8 language features. Don't forget
to set the source code compatibility to Java 8:

```groovy
android {
  compileOptions {
      sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
      targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
  kotlinOptions {
      jvmTarget = "1.8"
  }
}
```

# Testing

When unit testing your app's classes, `CoLocation` and `CoGeocoder` behavior can be mocked easily. See
`MainViewModelTest` in the `sample` project for an example test.
